Once a Goddess of Love and Care, Purity destroyed, lost in Despair. With big wide eyes, and a glowing stare, large white hooves, and glistening hair.

 <p Align="center" style="text-decoration:none; color: Silver;">“The Boy By The Lake” On a sunny day did She see, from peering behind a redwood tree. A boy by the lake, tan skin and dark hair. The Shadow Mare did hide out of Her despair, but the boy did see, that monster hiding behind the tree. And beckoned unto Shadow Mare, “Do not hide from me.” Ever so calmly did the boy speak, meaning not to provoke Her shriek, and the Mare did peak; just to look. The boy saw and his head shook. From left to right and with a smile he did say, “You are no monster, now come without delay.” To this the Mare Shown a most frightful grin, and cautiously trotted toward him. “If you come, sit, speak with me, a story from my eyelids shall you see.” To that She sat gently next to he, and question Shadow Mare did the boy of the Sea. Somehow, strange and slow, She began to gracefully glow. Her hair became fine as they passed the time, and curled at the bottom as She spoke in rhyme. The boy of the sea knew that The Leaving was neigh. So, from his eyelids he spoke, from his past did he provoke, tales of storms and raging seas, the calm of the land and the peace of the trees. The Mare listened as his tales did unfold, and away did Her dark mask dissolve. To show a more radiant She, the Goddess that She used to be. And he did see from Her vivacity, The Path of Truth flight not from his being. To this the Goddess spoke the kindest words with meaning, “Dearest Soul that purified me, take my hand and Blessed Be.”</p>

The one who caused this horrid blight, once out of view, now back in sight. Her legs did tremble, her heart did ache, her knees quickly began to quake. As he drew near, thus grew her fear. And with just a single tear, a horrid shriek did claw his ear.</p>
